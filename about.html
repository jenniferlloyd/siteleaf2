                    <h3><strong>What is the best treatment for GPA?</strong></h3>
                    <p>This trial is comparing two approaches to treatment for certain 
patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, also known as 
Wegener's granulomatosis). </p>
                    <p>We are comparing a low dose of prednisone, or no prednisone, for 
patients with GPA who are in remission (had a reduced number of symptoms
 or no change in GPA symptoms).</p>

                    <h3><strong>Finding the best way to use prednisone</strong>.</h3>
                    <p>Prednisone is a necessary treatment for many patients with GPA but 
can also be damaging to the body. Researchers want to improve daily life
 for patients with GPA by having them take less prednisone â€“ but without
 symptoms of GPA becoming worse, if possible.</p>
                    <p>Vasculitis researchers are still working to determine the best way 
to use prednisone when treating vasculitis. There have been many studies
 for other medical treatments for GPA, but prednisone (a common 
treatment for patients with GPA) has not been studied as much. </p>
                    <p>By comparing these two treatments (low dose of prednisone, or no 
prednisone) we hope to gain important insight in to which treatments 
really work best for GPA patients. </p>

                    <h3><strong>How this trial is different:</strong></h3>
                    <p>This trial allows patients to participate online.</p>
                    <p>Traditionally, research studies usually require patients to travel 
to a clinical center (a clinic or university that is running the trial).
 Many clinical centers can be several hours drive or even a flight away 
from home. This trial allows you the opportunity to participate while 
under the care of your own doctor.</p>
                    <p>When you choose to join The Assessment of Prednisone in Remission 
Trial (TAPIR), you don't have to disrupt your regular life to 
participate. You can easily sign up online, and you can give us 
information as to how you are feeling online at any time. </p>
                    <p>All participants in this trial will continue to get regular care from their local doctors.</p>
