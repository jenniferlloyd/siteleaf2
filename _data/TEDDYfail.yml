title: TEDDY Information for Researchers
content: >-
  The TEDDY Study is committed to maximizing its contribution to the greater scientific community. Beyond published findings, the TEDDY Study may also offer researchers everything from methods and technologies developed on study to the actual data and samples collected from participants.

  ## Data Assets


  A variety of different data types are collected as a part of the TEDDY study, including clinical metadata and laboratory test result data across various 'omics analytes. The TEDDY Data Coordinating Center (DCC) manages, curates, integrates, and provisions these data assets
  for analysis by TEDDY and approved external investigators. Existing TEDDY clinical and ‘omics data assets are summarized below and detailed in the linked documents.


  Clinical Metadata


  * Antibodies

  * Demographics

  * Diet

  * Genotypes

  * Case-Control Indicators

  * Household Exposures

  * Medications

  * Medical History

  * Family History

  * Pre and Perinatal Exposures

  * Psychosocial Stressors


  'Omics Analytes


  * Dietary Biomarkers

  * Exome

  * Gene Expression

  * Lipidomics

  * Metabolomics

  * Microbiome and Metagenomics

  * Proteomics

  * RNA Sequencing

  * SNPs

  * Whole Genome Sequencing

  ## Data Sharing


  The TEDDY Study has adopted policies and procedures in support of its
  commitment to sharing data with the scientific community while also protecting
  the privacy of participants. In accordance with the TEDDY Data Sharing Policy,
  data are made publicly available via designated controlled-access data
  repositories. A detailed listing of publicly available TEDDY data assets and
  instructions for accessing them via the relevant data repositories can be
  found in the links below. These data releases have been submitted at different
  time points and to various repositories, depending on NIH requirements and the
  nature of the data. Each submission is treated as an independent release,
  possessing uniquely masked subject and sample identifiers. Researchers may
  desire to combine data across these releases for analysis, but are unable to
  do so as a result of the independently masked identifiers. The NIDDK
  repository can now provide repository data release identifier mapping
  materials to satisfy this demand once the investigators have received approval
  to access the data. In addition, external investigators can obtain access to
  TEDDY 'omics data and the TEDDY Web Portal for analysis (see Data
  Infrastructure below) via application to the TEDDY Ancillary Studies
  Committee.


  TEDDY NIH Data Repository Submissions


  "Data Request Instructions:"


  * The database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGAP)

  * The NIDDK Central Repository

  * The Sequence Read Archive (SRA)


  TEDDY samples can also be made available to researchers as part of an
  ancillary study following the submission and approval of a proposal to the
  TEDDY Ancillary Studies Committee. Please email TEDDY@epi.usf.edu for more
  details.


  ## Data Infrastructure


  In its role as the TEDDY DCC, the USF Health Informatics Institute (HII) has
  developed a comprehensive platform for the acquisition, management,
  integration, analysis, and sharing of scientific data assets, particularly for
  the Big Data associated with ‘omics research. Access to this data
  infrastructure for TEDDY and approved external investigators is secured
  through advanced authentication and an integrated, token-based security model
  with data encryption. All identifiers are removed or dynamically masked to
  ensure research integrity and privacy of participants.


  The figure below depicts the various components of the data infrastructure
  developed and employed in support of the TEDDY study. More information can be
  found in the HII Data Infrastructure slides, hdExchange Platform Overview
  document, or by emailing TEDDY@epi.usf.edu.
