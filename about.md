## What we hope to learn from this trial

### **What is the best treatment for GPA?**

This trial is comparing two approaches to treatment for certain patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, also known as Wegener's granulomatosis).

We are comparing a low dose of prednisone, or no prednisone, for patients with GPA who are in remission (had a reduced number of symptoms or no change in GPA symptoms).

### **Finding the best way to use prednisone**.

Prednisone is a necessary treatment for many patients with GPA but can also be damaging to the body. Researchers want to improve daily life for patients with GPA by having them take less prednisone â€“ but without symptoms of GPA becoming worse, if possible.

Vasculitis researchers are still working to determine the best way to use prednisone when treating vasculitis. There have been many studies for other medical treatments for GPA, but prednisone (a common treatment for patients with GPA) has not been studied as much.

By comparing these two treatments (low dose of prednisone, or no prednisone) we hope to gain important insight in to which treatments really work best for GPA patients.

### **How this trial is different:**

This trial allows patients to participate online.

Traditionally, research studies usually require patients to travel to a clinical center (a clinic or university that is running the trial). Many clinical centers can be several hours drive or even a flight away from home. This trial allows you the opportunity to participate while under the care of your own doctor.

When you choose to join The Assessment of Prednisone in Remission Trial (TAPIR), you don't have to disrupt your regular life to participate. You can easily sign up online, and you can give us information as to how you are feeling online at any time.

All participants in this trial will continue to get regular care from their local doctors.
